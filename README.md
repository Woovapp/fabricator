I work in automation and pretty often i need to generate some dummy test data that need to be passed in one of the applications under test. Usually we have to create some generators for numbers, names, e-mails, addresses and so on in the project itself. And usually this generators don't look very nice and pretty often they generate test data that is not so "nicely" displayed - because it's random numbers and letters. So, instead of a name you can get some "jkashd" which is not nice, agree? ) So i decided to combine two things - learn scala and write my own library that i could use in different scala\java projects and generate nice and "close to real" data for my tests.
